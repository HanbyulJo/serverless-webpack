# Serverless Webpack

[![serverless](http://public.serverless.com/badges/v3.svg)](http://www.serverless.com)

A Serverless v1.0 plugin to build your lambda functions with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io).

## Install

```
npm install serverless-webpack
```

Add the plugin to your `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml
plugins:
  - serverless-webpack
```

By default the plugin will look for a `webpack.config.js` in the service directory.
In alternative you can specify a different file or configuration in the `serverless.yml` with:

```yaml
custom:
  webpack: ./folder/my-webpack.config.js
```

Note that, if the `output` configuration is not set, it will automatically be
generated to write bundles in the `.webpack` directory.

## Usage

### Automatic bundling

The normal Serverless deploy procedure will automatically bundle with Webpack:

- Create the Serverless project with `serverless create -t aws-node`
- Install Serverless Webpack as above
- Deploy with `serverless deploy`

### Simulate API Gateway locally

To start a local server that will act like the API Gateway use the following command.
Your code will be reloaded upon change so that every request to your local server
will serve the latest code.

```
serverless webpack serve
```

Options are:

- `--port` or `-p` (optional) The local server port. Defaults to `8000`

### Run a function locally

To run your bundled functions locally you can:

```
serverless webpack invoke --function <function-name>
```

Options are:

- `--function` or `-f` (required) is the name of the function to run
- `--path` or `-p` (optional) is a JSON file path used as the function input event

### Run a function locally on source changes

Or to run a function every time the source files change use `watch`:

```
serverless webpack watch --function <function-name> --path event.json
```

Options are:

- `--function` or `-f` (required) is the name of the function to run
- `--path` or `-p` (optional) is a JSON file path used as the function input event

### Bundle with webpack

To just bundle and see the output result use:

```
serverless webpack --out dist
```

Options are:

- `--out` or `-o` (optional) The output directory. Defaults to `.webpack`.

## Example with Babel

In the `example` folder there is a Serverless project using this plugin with Babel.
To try it, from inside the example folder:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `serverless webpack run -f hello` to run the example function
